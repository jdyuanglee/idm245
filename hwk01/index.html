        <a href="http://showcase.codethislab.com/games/funny_soccer/">Link to the game</a>
        <h3>WHY I enjoy playing this game:</h3>
        <p>I enjoy playing the game because it is not a easy game. Players will need to think about the strategy and opreating
            skill to win the game. Also the jumping mechanic and ball's speeding, bouncing is great.</p>
        <h3>WHAT could be improved about this game:</h3>
        <li>There is no jumping function in the game.</li>
        <li>Players cannot trun their heads to the another direction</li>
        <li>The timing mechanic is a infinite loop if no one has score.</li>

        <a href="http://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/asteroids/">Link to the game</a>
        <h3>WHY I enjoy playing this game:</h3>
        <p>Asteroids is a classic game. It's really a fun game to play using both of your hand either keyboard or controller.
            The mechanic is about no graviity so players need to anticipate the traffice so it's a lot of thinking and planning
            while playing.</p>
        <h3>WHAT could be improved about this game:</h3>
        <li>Player can play the game without moving but just shotting.</li>
        <li>It's so hard for player who never play this kind of game before.</li>
        <li>There is no way to know how to win the game.</li>
        <li>Difficuty is not changing with the socre gaining.</li>
